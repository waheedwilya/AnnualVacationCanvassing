## ⚠️ UNDERSTANDING WARNINGS

**🟡 Yellow Warning** = Someone more senior also wants this week  
→ You might still get it, but it's not guaranteed

**🔴 Red Warning** = Your department already has someone approved for this week  
→ You won't get this week (department limit reached)

**✅ No Warning** = Week is available, better chance of approval

---

## 📋 CHECK YOUR STATUS

**Go to:** "My Requests" tab

**Status Meanings:**
- ✅ **Approved** = Week is yours! Mark it on your calendar.
- ⏳ **Pending** = Supervisor is reviewing - check back later
- ❌ **Denied** = Week couldn't be approved (conflicts with others)

---

## 🎯 HOW APPROVALS WORK

1. **Seniority Matters** - Longer service = Higher priority
2. **Department Limits** - Only 1 person per department per week
3. **Priority Order** - Your Week #1 is considered first, then #2, etc.

✅ **Prioritize Wisely** - Put your most important weeks as #1, #2, #3
