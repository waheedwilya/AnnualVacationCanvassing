## 📊 WHAT YOU'LL SEE

**Requests grouped by Department**  
**Priority weeks numbered** (#1 = worker's top choice)  
**Conflict warnings highlighted** (yellow borders)  
**Seniority shown** (join date displayed)

---

## ✅ TWO WAYS TO APPROVE

### Option 1: Manual Approval ⚙️
**Review each request:**
- ✓ **Approve** = Approve this week
- ✗ **Deny** = Deny this week
- × **Revert** = Undo decision

**Rules:**
- Only **1 person per department per week**
- **More senior workers** get priority (earlier join date)
- Honor **worker's priority order** (Week #1 before #2)

### Option 2: Auto-Allocate 🤖
**Click "Auto-Allocate" button**
- System automatically sorts by seniority
- Allocates weeks based on priority order
- Respects department limits
- Handles conflicts automatically

**Faster and ensures fairness!**

---

## ⚠️ CONFLICT RESOLUTION

**Same Week + Same Department = CONFLICT**
→ Only 1 person can be approved
→ More senior worker gets priority

**Same Week + Different Departments = NO CONFLICT**
→ Both can be approved

**Look for:** Yellow borders around conflicting weeks

---

## 🔄 RESET & UNDO

**Reset All** = Start over (resets all approvals to pending)

**Revert (×)** = Undo a single week decision

---

## 📋 RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW

1. **Review requests** by department (use filter dropdown)
2. **Check conflicts** (yellow warnings)
3. **Choose method:**
   - Manual review for full control, OR
   - Auto-Allocate for speed and fairness
4. **Verify results** and make adjustments if needed

---

## 🎯 KEY PRINCIPLES

✅ **Seniority First** - Longer service = Higher priority
