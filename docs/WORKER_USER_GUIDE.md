│  ⚠️ Yellow = Senior person selected    │
│  🔴 Red = Department limit reached      │

│  [ Submit Request (4/10 weeks) ]       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Tips:**
- 📌 **Priority matters!** Week #1 is your top choice, Week #2 is second, and so on
- ⬆️⬇️ Use the **up/down arrows** to reorder your weeks if you change your mind

- 🔴 **Red warnings** = Too many people from your department already selected this week
- ✅ You can still select these weeks, but they might not get approved

### Step 3: Submit Your Request

1. Once you've selected your weeks (minimum 1, maximum 2× entitlement)
2. Review your priority order

```

**Status Meanings:**

- ⏳ **Pending** = Supervisor hasn't decided yet. Check back later.
- ❌ **Denied** = This week couldn't be approved (conflicts with other workers)

---

## 🔄 How Approval Works

Your requests are reviewed by your supervisor, who considers:

1. **Your Seniority** (how long you've worked here)
   - More senior = higher priority
   
2. **Department Limits**
   - Only 1 person per department can take vacation the same week
   - Different departments can overlap

3. **Priority Order**
   - Your Week #1 is considered before Week #2, and so on

**Example Flow:**
```
You submit:    [Week #1] → [Week #2] → [Week #3] → [Week #4]
                    ↓          ↓           ↓           ↓
Supervisor:    [Approved] [Approved] [Pending]   [Denied]
                    ✅         ✅         ⏳          ❌
```
